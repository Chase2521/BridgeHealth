       <p>Wow! What a page turner, not at all what I expected, yet exactly what I should have expected.  I expected a book about maladjusted kids and how bad parenting can lead to difficult children and adults with issues.  Wrong! This book is so much more important than that.  This book taught me about real trauma in childhood and the absolute champions that are these children, the caregivers that are doing their best, and the medical teams that help them.  Champions all of them and people like them everywhere.
       <br><br>
       This book is about patients of co-author Bruce D. Perry throughout his carreer as a child psychiatrist, how he came to learn the things he knows today about our development, and how he developed his treatment model.  Bruce D. Perry and Maia Szalavitz compose a wonderfully detailed, heartbreaking, and yet optimistic symphony of the meaning of love, stability, and potential for healing in our lives.

       This is definitely a must read for parents, caregivers, and everyone else that would like to know more about how our brains are shaped by early experiences.  As a student of biology, this book reinforced and built upon my understanding of brain connections and how repetetive behavior can strengthen those connections.  In cases of repetetive trauma, those connections can be hard to combat.  Read slowly and monitor your own well being as you go through this book.  Proceed with caution, these stories can be difficult to get through.
