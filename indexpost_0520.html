       <p>Positivity is more than a character trait for me, it is a way of life.  Struggling with depression, whether it is constant or wanes and waxes, can be an all consuming effort that is exhausting.  When living in Taiwan, I was fortunate to have heard a single line that clicked for me and taught me that my stuggle was best fought on a different front.  Instead of fighting against low points, I made it a life goal to always remain on the happiness high.  I am not always successful, but it has been extremely rewarding.  Professionally, my happiness has been misinterpreted as juvenile, but I am very lucky to have found places and people that take happiness seriously and appreciate positivity.  This method is not right for everyone, but I wanted to take this chance to talk about our attitudes and how we can keep a strong mental fortitude while in quarantine.<br><br>Going back before the 1980s, there have been researchers looking into the effects of expressive writing on psychological well being.  The first article I am bringing up for your consideration is from 2010, in the British Journal of Health Psychology (V.13 Iss. 1).  "Seeing the glass half full: Optimistic expressive writing improves mental health among chronically stressed caregivers" by Corey S. Mackenzie et al. did not find support for their main hypothesis, but did find that expresive writing that used increasingly positive, optimistic, and future-focused language helped caregivers of older adults.  You may have to pay for the full article unless you are a student, but follow this link to the Wiley Online Library. <br><br><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1348/135910707X251153" alt="link to Wiley Online Library">Click Here</a><br><br>In 2018 a study looked at expresive writing specifically as a PPI (Positive Psychological Intervention).  The previous article and "Does gratitude writing improve the mental health of psychotherapy clients? Evidence from a randomized controlled trial" by Y. Joel Wong et al. pair very well together as the second article builds with direction on the findings of the first.  In Y. Joel Wong et al. researchers used three groups, one with psychotherapy only, one that had psychotherapy and expressive writing exercises that involved writing deeply about their feelings, and a last group that had psychotherapy and wrote positive notes of gratitude and the future.  There were significant differences in the language and outlook of those that wrote positive notes in their exercise, and no significant differences between the group that had psychotherapy only and the group that also had expressive writing.<br><br>Read the full article in this link: <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10503307.2016.1169332" alt="link to Taylor & Francis Online">Click Here</a><br><br>In no way do I or these researchers suggest that positive writing can replace necessary psychotherapy, but I would suggest giving positive writing a try to combat any negativity that quarantine has brought into your life.<br><br>By focusing on the positive and not combating the negative, I have seen changes in my life.  I have even tried my hand at writing now and again.  Poetry is a great way to express gratitude and positive future thinking.  My prose has been a little less positive, but even then, I did feel some (not supported scientifically by the articles above) catharsis that made me feel better.  My longer writing ambitions are their own roller coaster of expression, positivity, and hopelessness.  That is a struggle with attention that I will bring into a later post.  For now, get writing, and write your way to a more positive brain!
