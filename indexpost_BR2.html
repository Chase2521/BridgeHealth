       <h2>Book Review: Liebes Kind</h2>
       <date>Reviewed By Chase Davis</date>

       <p>This book came to me in the most amazing way.  While vacationing in Bali, I struck up a conversation with a lovely german couple staying at the same hotel.  I expressed interest in the book and when the gentleman reading it had finished, he passed it to me.  I brought it home, and started reading as soon as I finished <span style="text-decoration-line: underline;">The Boy Who Was Raised as a Dog</span>.
       <br><br>
       Break out your German dictionaries, this book is worth the read. This book has been described as a mix of Gone Girl and The Room.  Having seen both movies, I see the similarity.  Having just finished a book on child psychiatry, I have to say that author Romy Hausmann did an incredible job at displaing the effects of early childhood experiences.  Her subject and style were impressive and the whole book rolled out keeping me locked in chapter to chapter.  Even for a non-native German speaker, it was hard to put down.
       <br><br>
       Liebes Kind, or Dear Child as a potential translation, is about a woman held in captivity, and her life after escaping.  I can't tell much more out of fear that I will ruin any of the twists that make it such a delectable read.  Know however, that it deals with heavy material like abuse, depression, PTSD, and physical and emotional trauma.  Mental health isn't about denying or avoiding negativity, but understanding it and talking about it.  This book is a great discussion and could be very helpful.
