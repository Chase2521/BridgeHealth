      <h3>System for speed mathematics</h3>
      <p><strong>Jakow Trachtenberg  (1888 - 1953)</strong>, a Jewish mathematician, developed this system of mental calculation techiniques.  Trachtenberg was born in Ukraine and a known pacifist, and when war broke out in 1914 he helped organize a society known as the Society of Good Samaritans.  This society was formed to help train Russian students to take care of the wounded.  <br><br>
      Before the break of World War II, Jakow was critical of Nazi policies.  During the war, he was imprisoned in a Nazi concentration camp.  Keeping his mind sharp, Jakow developed this system of basic mathematics during his imprisonment. <br><br>
      Jakow Trachtenberg escaped more than once, from more than one concentration camp and often with help from his wife who gave everything in order to protect him.  After he escaped for good, and the war was over, Jakow continued to bring education and progress to the world. He died in 1953 in Switzerland.  <br><br>
      I encourage you to purchase a copy of The Trachtenberg Method, and learn more about his amazing life.  <br><br>
      <h3>Some background on the method:</h3>
      <br>In the next few pages, you will learn a summarized version of the whole Trachtenberg method.  There are two key principles that you should know to help you.  <br><br><h4>Neighbor</h4><br>Neighbor in the following pages always refers to the digit immediately to the right.  If you are looking at the first (furthest right) digit in a number, its neighbor is a 0 that you should imagine to the right of that digit.  When you get to the last digit (furthest left) you should imagine a 0 to the left of that digit so that the last digit becomes its neighbor.  Like this: <br><blockquote>557829 should be imagined like this <strong>0</strong>557829<strong>0</strong></blockquote><br>
      <h4>Half</h4><br>When halfing a number it is generally straight forward.  For odd numbers however, you should always round down.  When told to take have a number, when you see 7 you should immediately think 3.  Half of 1 is 0.  Practice with the numbers below. <br><blockquote>1 2  5  8  3  9  8  4  6</blockquote> In your head you should think (from right to left) 3 2 4 4 1 4 2 1 0.  With this in mind.  Please enjoy learning more about the Trachtenberg rules of speed mathematics.</p>
