       <p>I can't think of a bad time for alliteration, and this month's topic makes me very excited.
June 23, 2020 Ontario Ministry of Education introduced expanded mathematics curriculum for grades 1 through 8 that will include financial literacy and coding.  This is a huge step forward considering the last update to the elementary math curriculum was in 2005.  Hoping for the best, I believe this is a wonderful sign of the opportunity for future generations to jump into an industry that already governs so many parts of our every-day life.  I support these types of changes whole-heartedly and at the same time have questions and food for thought.
<br><br>
Question: Will math teachers also learn economics and coding?<br>
<br> Perhaps for grades 1-8 math teachers won’t need extra economics degrees.  I would guess that a teacher provided with material and course objectives could expand on material and provide an enriching experience for students.  As far as coding goes, I think this may put a strain on older educators and could be considered ageism.  That is not to say that people aren’t amazing.  I believe that people always manage to surprise, and many math teachers could rise to this occasion and do amazing wonderful things.
<br>The teacher that made the most lasting impression in my life taught me German from grades 9-12.  After I graduated this teacher also taught ESL to a remarkably diverse group of students and to me, that was not surprising.  In addition to German this teacher also spoke 5 or more other languages fluently.  Many ESL students at that school were dealing with complicated mental health stressors, culture shock, the general teen angst, and tended to take it out on teachers.  This teacher put up with my shenanigans, and I knew that they could do remarkable things with students that needed extra understanding.  All of this being said, absorbing the usual German students and adding on additional responsibilities is a daunting task that I am positive added stress and difficulty.  Are we asking too much of Math teachers?
<br><br>Teachers mold the next generation and deserve more money and more help.  That is my political leaning in this situation.
<br><br>
Food for thought:  the best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago, the second-best time to plant a tree is today.  <br><br>
Critics of these changes say that implementing them during Covid-19 is irresponsible.  The added pressure on parents to help their children cover even more topics and the pressure on teachers is too much, says the opposition.  These changes are already coming late to developed countries and we cannot wait for a more convenient time for us to prepare the next generation for real life in the future.  We should teach this generation and be an example of disease transmission and do our part to stop the spread of Coronavirus.  At the same time, <strong>we should not delay any advantage we can provide for them.  </strong><br>
BHA believes in teaching the next generation about strong mental fortitude, and math and coding will be vital for their future health.  Contact us about classes and tutoring.  I am a self-taught web developer and coding this site has been extremely rewarding.  These changes are good, and I hope we do not have to go another 15 years to update our curriculum.  <br><br><strong>Need a website built? <br><br>
