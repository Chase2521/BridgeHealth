      Of thoughtless youth; but hearing oftentimes <br>
      The still, sad music of humanity…” <br>

       <p>The romantic period, what a wonderful time to be a writer.  It was a movement in literature identified by its emphasis on sensual experiences and a heightened sensitivity to one’s environment.  Much of the poetry of William Wordsworth captures the sights, sounds, tastes, and feelings of nature.  However, William Wordsworth was an anosmic.  He could not smell and therefore his works only contain a metaphysical sense of smell.  With each breath and the shifting of air around us along the heat waves of our very bodies, our sense of smell is stimulated and we are making judgments about the world around us.  When asked which of your five senses you would be most willing to lose, most people assuredly decide that smell is least necessary for survival.  It is a tragedy to lose any of one’s senses, sight, hearing, touch, taste, or smell, but it is all too natural for us to desire to retain our noble senses above all.  <br><br>
Sight and hearing are known as our noble senses.  Touch and taste are known as proximity senses.  Smell, which relies on both an external and internal medium of transportation, escapes many of our classification systems and is thus often considered inferior. [2] Smell is often considered a sense of luxury.  However, for those who are inexperienced in the trials of this physical disability it is difficult to understand the gravity of losing one’s sense of smell.  Anosmia, the inability to smell, can be a crippling disorder with abstract side effects that are still the subject of research across the world.  Wordsworth provides us one frame of context for the importance smell plays in our lives.  He was a romantic writer who was perpetually separated from the world around him because he simply could not absorb scent.  With the greatest respect for those who face daily hardships due to anosmia, this paper will attempt to highlight a sensation that escapes much of our understanding.  <br><br>
	The goal of this paper is to discuss a historical perspective on the effects of post traumatic anosmia.  From ancient and pre-modern views on the importance of smell both psychologically and biologically to modern elucidation of the olfactory system, readers will become aware of the great world of odors around them.  In the light of the olfactory awakening, modern studies on anosmia will deeply contrast with the world of odors. The comparison of smell to total lack of smell will let readers experience the life of an anosmic, and specifically the effects of non-congenital, post-traumatic anosmia.  The heart of this elucidation encompassing three main points: a short history of neuroscience, awareness about a less known condition, and information for the anosmic on some of the trials they may be experiencing. <br><br>
