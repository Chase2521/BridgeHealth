       <h2>Why I Love My Quarantine Life</h2>
       <date>By Chase Davis - April 2020</date>

     <div class="content-text">
       <p>The Coronavirus, AKA "Covid19", is serious.  I have heard some people say, "we don't react this seriously for the flu..." and I believe the feeling is that the world wide response is an over reaction.  Its hard to oppose this argument, because my first thought is, "this must be more serious than the flu...because we don't react this seriously for the flu."  China doesn't shut down over a lot of things, but they shut down to stop the spread of Coronavirus. Conspiracy theory aside, this is a drastic measure. <br><br>With all of that in mind, BHA supports togetherness and teamwork more than anything.  Its important to not promote divisiveness and separation (except for social distancing *wink).  So this is why I want to bring you my positive take on our curerent quarantine lifestyle, and say how proud I am of everyone I have seen (or not seen rather) doing their part to stop the spread of Coronavirus. <br><br>If you are socially awkward, a natural introvert, a homebody, or have social anxiety, this is a golden time for you.  Reach out through the technology platforms that have kept you connected to the outside world for years, and now more than ever people will understand how you are expressing that you care.  Or don't reach out and just enjoy that now your habbits are more supported than ever before.  You can bask in the wonderful feeling of acting naturally socially acceptably.  <br><br>For me personally, I have read more since the start of Coronavirus than I have read in the past two years combined.  I have reignited my love of books and early mornings in the Canadian spring air.  It is truly a wonder to sit with an open window with the fresh morning air wafting in and filling the room.  During or after a big rain, having just finished a short, in-home workout, I sit and read "Liebes Kind" (book review to follow).  If I plan my night just right, I can get up in early enough to have a few hours before I close myself in my office now that I am part of the WFH (work from home) crew.  <br><br>I have heard that a lot of people have lost thier jobs in this mess and I really know how that feels.  I have spent a good ammount of time between jobs.  I try to fill each of these gaps with learning something new or planning a new business venture.  If you have no other choice, then now is the time to lean into it and see what you can do to get out of the rat race.  As always, BHA hopes to bring more digital connectivity and solutions to health operations, mental health, and education.
